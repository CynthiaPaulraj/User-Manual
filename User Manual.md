# The Role of Machine Learning in Data Science
## Introduction:
**Machine Learning** plays a vital role in Data Science. Data Science is a study of data in a systematic manner which helps in identifying the solutions for the problem and decision-making in business. **Data Science** helps in analysing the data to predict the future outcomes. 
Machine Learning processes the data automatically, studies the data, and gives us an insight for business to reach its goal. It helps in getting an overview of marketing, strategy, and customer desires. The machine learning has been trained with the data model to make the real-time predictions.
### Data Science: 
Data Science is a study of data to get an insight for business. It combines mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyse the large amount of data and get the predictions for decision-making in business.
#### Data Science Life Cycle
Data Science uses machine learning to get predictions for decision-making. To get the predictions, data science follows a process to make the large amount of raw data to the thoughtful insights.

**_1.	Business Understanding:_**
To succeed in business, a person must understand commercial enterprise goals relevant to the business. Only if a person able to predict the outcomes like customer desires, helps in minimizing the loss and predict the rate of succeed. 

**_2.	Data Mining:_**
Data Mining is the process of analysing the large amount of data to identify the pattern and extract the useful information. It helps in increasing the sales and decrease the unnecessary cost.

**_3.	Data Cleaning:_**
Data Cleaning is the process of fixing, removing the incorrect data, remove the duplicate data, fill the incomplete data with the dataset predictions. As the raw data combines from multiples sources, a lot of chances are there to be mislabeled or duplicated. The Data cleaning helps in getting the accurate data.

**_4.	Data Exploaration:_**
Data Exploaration helps in analysing the data through data visualization and statistical techniques to describe the dataset characteristics, such as size, quantity, gender, and accuracy to better understand the data. 

**_5.	Predictive Modeling:_**
Predictive Modeling uses statistical techniques to predict the future behavior. It analyses historical and current data and generate a model to predict the future outcomes.

**_6.	Data Visualization:_**
Data Visualization is a representation of data through common graphics, such as charts, plots, infographics, animations for better understanding.

The role of Machine Learning in Data Science:
Machine Learning:
Machine Learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) which allows any software applications to be more precise and accurate for finding and predicting outcomes. Machine Learning uses algorithms to predict the outcomes.
Machine Learning analyses and examines large amount of data automatically. It automates the data analysis process and makes prediction in real-time without any human involvement. The machine learning has been trained with the data model to make the real-time predictions.
Types of Machine Learning and the process:
Machine Learning types:
1.	Supervised Learning
2.	Unsupervised Learning
3.	Reinforcement Learning
4.	Ensemble Learning
5.	Neural Networks

| Supervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning | Reinforcement Learning |
| ------ | ------| ------------- |
| Supervised Learning is a category of machine learning that uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to predict outcomes and recognize patterns.  The training model continues until the model achieves the desired level of accuracy on the training data.  Regression, Decision tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression statistics methods are used in the Supervised Learning. | Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that learns from data without human intervention. These models are given unlabeled data and allowed to discover patterns and insights without any guidance or instruction. It uses self-learning algorithms. This is best suited for large complex dataâ€™s and useful in identifying undetected patterns of data. Clustering statistics method is used in this model.| Reinforcement Learning (RL) is machine learning technique that trains software to make decisions to achieve the most optimal results. It mimics the trial-and-error learning process that human use to achieve their goals. |

`Ensemble Learning`

Ensemble Learning is an approach in which two or more models are fitted to the same data, and the predictions for each model are combined to achieve better performance. It yields better results if there are significant differences among the models

Neural Networks:

A neural network teaches computers to process data that is inspired by the human brain. It is also called deep learning. It uses interconnected nodes in a layered structure that resembles the human brain.

Neural networks make intelligent decisions with limited human assistance. It makes general observations without explicit training. It shows its best results using Natural Language processing (NLP) method.

Conclusion:
Thus, Machine Learning plays an important role in Data Science by automating the process, and forecasting the outcomes for commercial decision-making.
